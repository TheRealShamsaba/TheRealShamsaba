### 🧠 Who Am I?

I'm a computer engineering student in **Istanbul**
I build things that look good, work well, and sometimes even surprise people.  
I believe in solving real problems and letting my curiosity and ideas go with no limits.

Currently working on:
- 🛒 A boutique-style e-commerce site (with some fancy animations)
- ♟️ Chess engine for my graduation project
- 🕷️ A web crawler project that filters useful content intelligently
- 🧠 Using AI tools to make dev life easier (or at least funnier)
